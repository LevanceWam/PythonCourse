<h2 id="section1">Primitive Types</h2>

First section of the videos just going over the basics of python. <br>
This section included:


<li>Expressions</li>
<li>Pylint</li>
<li>Syntax</li>
<li>Numbers</li>
<li>Strings</li>


<h2 id="section2">Control Flow</h2>
Second section of the videos.<br>
This section included:

<li>For Loops</li>
<li>Nested Loops</li>
<li>Conditionals</li>
<li>For Else</li>
<li>Operators</li>
<li>Ternary Operators</li>
<li>While Loops</li>

<h2 id="section3">Functions</h2>
Third section of videos on python.
<br>
In this section I learned a lot about how functions worked.
I created a cool fizzbuzz program in python that ddint take me very long to make.

Also learned the difference between arguments and parameters that a lot of young coders miss.
<br>
This section included:

<li>Arguments</li>
<li>Debugging</li>
<li>Defining Functions</li>
<li>Keyword arguments</li>
<li>xargs</li>
<li>xxargs</li>
<li>Types of Functions</li>

<h2 id="section4">Data Stuctures</h2>
Fourth section of my videos on python.
<br>

In this section I learned a lot about loops, dictionaries,
tuples and so much more.

I learned to iterate through these and how to add, remove, delete and to use more of their various methods.

The exercise for this section was a interesting one I figured out a solution to the problem but I now realize it code be improved. This is great because this is one of the interview questions.
<br>

This section included:

<li>Accessing Items</li>
<li>Adding and Removing Items</li>
<li>Arrays</li>
<li>Dictionaries</li>
<li>Filter Functions</li>
<li>Map Functions</li>
<li>Finding Items</li>
<li>Lambda Functions</li>
<li>List</li>
<li>Looping List</li>
<li>Unpacking</li>
<li>Tuples</li>
<li>Zip Functions</li>

<h2 id="section5">Expections</h2>
 Expections are errors exterminates the excution of a program.
 <br>

 Learned about the risk of raising your own expections in a function.
 Slows down program greatly try to avoid it if possible.
 <br>

 This section included:

<li>Handling Expections</li>
<li>Handling Different Expections</li> 
<li>Raising Expections</li>
<li>With Statements</li>

<h2 id="section6">Classes</h2>
 Are the blueprint for creating new objects

 <p>Classes can Inherit methods from each other to help keep the code dry.</p>

 <p>We want to be careful when we are using inheritance tho because we don't want it were we have multi-leveled classes going off eachother. This is because if one crash it can cause a chain reaction causing you to go back to find the issue and causing the same or different issue to another class.</p>

<p>We also want to be careful having multiple classes going of one class. It is ok to have anywhere from 2 - 3 going of one class otherwise you'll start to see you are having classes to have classes.</p>


This section included:
<li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
<li>Classes</li>
<li>Constructors</li>
<li>Data Classes</li>
<li>Inheritance</li>
<li>Magic Methods</li>
<li>Private Members</li>
<li>Polymorphism</li>
<li>Properties</li>
<li>Creating Custom Containers</li>

<h2 id="section7">Modules</h2>
<p> Are files that have some python code. They can have:</p>

<li>Classes</li>
<li>Functions</li>
<li>Methods</li>
<li>Attributes and Etc.</li>
<br>

<p> We can also compile our python files. By compiling the files we are speeding up the modules load time. This does not speed up the file itself though. Also when you update the file Python will go and check the compiler and update it for you when it runs.</p>

<p>Packages in python  are containers for 1 or more modules.</p>

<p>When you add  <b>__init__.py </b>  python will look at the folder as a package.</p>

<h2 id="section8">Python Standard Library</h2> 

<p>In this section I learned a lot about the Python library and what it has to offer. I've practice with and learned a lot from packages such as Time Delta, webbrowser and so much more.</p>

<p>I learned also how to make csv files right inside of python, and how to use SQLite and Json</p>

<p>This Section included:</p>
<br>

<li>Sending Emails</li>
<li>Opening Browsers with Python</li>
<li>Working with CSV</li>
<li>Working with JSON</li>
<li>SQLite</li>
<li>Zip Files</li>
<li>Generating Random Values</li>

<h2 id="section9">Python Packaging Index</h2>
<p>In this section I learned a lot of the basics of using pip3 and all the awesome things I can do with it.</p>

<p>I learned a lot of useful terminal commands as shown below, learned how to updated my dependencies and create a virtual enviroment.</p>

```
pypi.org
pip3 install
pip3 install --upgrade pip
```

<h2 id="section10">Popular Python Packages</h2>

<p>In this section I will be learning about Popular packages in python and learning about some APIs </p>

Tools Needed:
<li>Yelp Api</li>
