# Python Course

This is a course that I am taking from the programming with mosh videos.

## Primitive Types

First section of the videos just going over the basics of python. <br>
This section included:


<li>Expressions</li>
<li>Pylint</li>
<li>Syntax</li>
<li>Numbers</li>
<li>Strings</li>


## Control Flow
Second section of the videos.<br>
This section included:

<li>For Loops</li>
<li>Nested Loops</li>
<li>Conditionals</li>
<li>For Else</li>
<li>Operators</li>
<li>Ternary Operators</li>
<li>While Loops</li>

## Functions
Third section of videos on python.
<br>
In this section I learned a lot about how functions worked.
I created a cool fizzbuzz program in python that ddint take me very long to make.

Also learned the difference between arguments and parameters that a lot of young coders miss.
<br>
This section included:

<li>Arguments</li>
<li>Debugging</li>
<li>Defining Functions</li>
<li>Keyword arguments</li>
<li>xargs</li>
<li>xxargs</li>
<li>Types of Functions</li>

## Data Stuctures
Fourth section of my videos on python.
<br>

In this section I learned a lot about loops, dictionaries,
tuples and so much more.

I learned to iterate through these and how to add, remove, delete and to use more of their various methods.

The exercise for this section was a interesting one I figured out a solution to the problem but I now realize it code be improved. This is great because this is one of the interview questions.
<br>

This section included:

<li>Accessing Items</li>
<li>Adding and Removing Items</li>
<li>Arrays</li>
<li>Dictionaries</li>
<li>Filter Functions</li>
<li>Map Functions</li>
<li>Finding Items</li>
<li>Lambda Functions</li>
<li>List</li>
<li>Looping List</li>
<li>Unpacking</li>
<li>Tuples</li>
<li>Zip Functions</li>

## Expections
 Expections are errors exterminates the excution of a program.
 <br>

 Learned about the risk of raising your own expections in a function.
 Slows down program greatly try to avoid it if possible.
 <br>

 This section included:

<li>Handling Expections</li>
<li>Handling Different Expections</li> 
<li>Raising Expections</li>
<li>With Statements</li>

## Classes
 Are the blueprint for creating new objects

 <p>Classes can Inherit methods from each other to help keep the code dry.</p>

 <p>We want to be careful when we are using inheritance tho because we don't want it were we have multi-leveled classes going off eachother. This is because if one crash it can cause a chain reaction causing you to go back to find the issue and causing the same or different issue to another class.</p>

<p>We also want to be careful having multiple classes going of one class. It is ok to have anywhere from 2 - 3 going of one class otherwise you'll start to see you are having classes to have classes.</p>


This section included:
<li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
<li>Classes</li>
<li>Constructors</li>
<li>Data Classes</li>
<li>Inheritance</li>
<li>Magic Methods</li>
<li>Private Members</li>
<li>Polymorphism</li>
<li>Properties</li>
<li>Creating Custom Containers</li>

## Modules
<p> Are files that have some python code. They can have:</p>

<li>Classes</li>
<li>Functions</li>
<li>Methods</li>
<li>Attributes and Etc.</li>
<br>

<p> We can also compile our python files. By compiling the files we are speeding up the modules load time. This does not speed up the file itself though. Also when you update the file Python will go and check the compiler and update it for you when it runs.</p>

<p>Packages in python  are containers for 1 or more modules.</p>

<p>When you add ```__init__.py``` python will look at the folder as a package.</p>
