# Python Course

This is a course that I am taking from the programming with mosh videos.

## Primitive Types

First section of the videos just going over the basics of python. <br>
This section included:


<li>Expressions</li>
<li>Pylint</li>
<li>Syntax</li>
<li>Numbers</li>
<li>Strings</li>


## Control Flow
Second section of the videos.<br>
This section included:

<li>For Loops</li>
<li>Nested Loops</li>
<li>Conditionals</li>
<li>For Else</li>
<li>Operators</li>
<li>Ternary Operators</li>
<li>While Loops</li>

## Functions
Third section of videos on python.
<br>
In this section I learned a lot about how functions worked.
I created a cool fizzbuzz program in python that ddint take me very long to make.

Also learned the difference between arguments and parameters that a lot of young coders miss.
<br>
This section included:

<li>Arguments</li>
<li>Debugging</li>
<li>Defining Functions</li>
<li>Keyword arguments</li>
<li>xargs</li>
<li>xxargs</li>
<li>Types of Functions</li>

## Data Stuctures
Fourth section of my videos on python.
<br>

In this section I learned a lot about loops, dictionaries,
tuples and so much more.

I learned to iterate through these and how to add, remove, delete and to use more of their various methods.

The exercise for this section was a interesting one I figured out a solution to the problem but I now realize it code be improved. This is great because this is one of the interview questions.
<br>

This section included:

<li>Accessing Items</li>
<li>Adding and Removing Items</li>
<li>Arrays</li>
<li>Dictionaries</li>
<li>Filter Functions</li>
<li>Map Functions</li>
<li>Finding Items</li>
<li>Lambda Functions</li>
<li>List</li>
<li>Looping List</li>
<li>Unpacking</li>
<li>Tuples</li>
<li>Zip Functions</li>

## Expections
 Expections are errors exterminates the excution of a program.
 <br>

 Learned about the risk of raising your own expections in a function.
 Slows down program greatly try to avoid it if possible.
 <br>

 This section included:

<li>Handling Expections</li>
<li>Handling Different Expections</li> 
<li>Raising Expections</li>
<li>With Statements</li>
