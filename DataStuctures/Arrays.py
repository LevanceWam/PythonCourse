from array import array
# arrays share a lot of the same methods as list
# append
# remove
# insert
# pop
numbers = array("i", [1, 2, 3])
# unlike list the objects in the array are typed
# so if we put a float or anything that is not the same type ot will give a error
# Only use arrays when you have a large sequence of numbers and sre experiecing issues
